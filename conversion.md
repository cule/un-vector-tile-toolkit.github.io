# Conversion
# Overview
We provide some tools to convert existing vector tiles so that UN Vector Tile Toolkit can be used for such vector tiles.

We have developed a tool to convert GeoJSON vector tiles to vector tiles based on [vector-tile-spec](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec).

# Developed scripts
