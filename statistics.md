# Statistics
# Overview
It is essential to control the size of individual vector tiles, in order to make them faster than image tiles. 

We have developed scripts to take mbtiles and output the statistics of the vector tiles.

# Developed scripts
- [mbq](https://github.com/hfu/mbq): A tool to get qmatrix from mbtiles
- [mbstat](https://github.com.hfu/mbstat): A tool to get statistical information from mbtiles

# Developed concept
- [q](https://github.com/hfu/q): Quantity level
